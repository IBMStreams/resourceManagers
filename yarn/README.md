####Integration of InfoSphere Streams with Apache YARN

This integration allows the management of streams instances using the YARN framework. A single "Streams Application Master" is capable of handling multiple Streams instances. Only one running instance of the Streams Application Master within a YARN instance is supported at this time. See resourceManagers/yarn/com.ibm.streams.yarn/README for more details on setup and use. 

Note that the configuration of YARN and available cluster resources must be done prior to running this program. Please refer to the YARN documentation for additional information.
